			<h1>Help build an open community for musicians and bands.</h1>
			<h2>Fediverse, Mastodon, and Beyond</h2>
			<p>Every post is accessible to the millions on people on the Fediverse -- using servers like Mastodon, Misskey, and others -- where they can boost and share your music to their communities. Fans not on the Fediverse? No problem. They can subscribe to your news feed via email, too.</p>
			<h2>Gorgeous Album Pages</h2>
			<p>Go viral with custom designed album pages that showcase your music, with album art, liner notes, and more.</p>
			<h2>Audio Streaming</h2>
			<p>Upload audio files and your fans can play songs directly from your album pages. Or, link to your music on popular streaming services like Spotify, Soundcloud, and more.</p>
			<h2>Tour Dates and Tickets</h2>
			<p>Promote your event calendar and tour dates now live on the Fediverse, so your fans will always know how to see you in person, and can tell their online community to show up at the box office, too.</p>
			<h2>And More...</h2>
			<p>Music discovery? Online sales? Analytics? There&#39;s a lot more in store as the community grows. This is a 100% open source effort, so you could even roll your own, if you want. Your insights make a difference in what we make and how we build, so speak up about what works and what doesn&#39;t, and we&#39;ll make it happen together.</p>
